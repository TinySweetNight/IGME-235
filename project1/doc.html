    <p><b>Goal:</b> <br>
     The goal for this site is to present a fictional piece of media for audiences who are invested in my work (THE STC) hence why it is framed like an interview/article. also
     why there is The Web labled in the corner because it's the name of the company interviewing Jack and Arthur. </p>

    <p><b>Notes:</b><br>
    I could only choose between having the text layout the same as the image or have the text wrap around the image. 
    I am unsure how to do both at the moment so I settled for having the text layout be the same as it looks the closest.

      Writing the lore out was annoying, I spent so long trying to think of things to add. Also I drew all the images myself. </p>

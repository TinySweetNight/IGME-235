          <h3>Protectors of Earth!</h3>

   <div>
            
     <p class="start"><i>"You know, running a place like this isn't easy. Eldritch creatures love the taste of human flesh, and most of our 
        employees are human. It takes a toll on our bank with all the medical expenses." <br>
        -Arthur Warren <br> <br></i>
             
              The Watchtower started when Arthur Warren and Jack Mendwick stumbled across an abandoned factory by the Eldritch demi-god (Titan) Azaikis. 
              By all accounts, they never intended to start protecting the good people of Earth from Eldritch influences invading the world, however,
               it came to them as they needed an excuse to reside inside of the Watchtower 
               lest they be evicted from the property by the CTMC(Corporate Titan Management Company). Over time, their numbers grew as humans, and other eldritch alike stumble 
               across their abode seeking refuge. For a measely $26-40 per hour paycheck, these individuals can help the Watchtower fight off the invasion of Earth.
              <br> How they deal with the Eldritch threats, I hear you wondering! I'll tell you how! The Watchtower implores a variety of custom trinkets to their adventures.
              Their most famous is a wristwatch where you turn the hands to imput different numbers to make up a coordinate, then you press down on the top part to summon a 
              rift to the coordinates! Then they use tranquilizer darts, nets, or plain old laser guns to wrangle foes of fearsome variety. The Watchtower has a system to decide which 
              creatures should be either relocated, watched, or eradicated! 

             </p>

                <p class="sidea"> In response to me asking about some fun stories from their beginnings at the Watchtower. Jack mentioned the factory not having any power to it at the start.
                    So, Arthur and him devised a plan to sneak into Azaikis' factory under disguse of pizza delivery employees (which was actually Jack's old job beforehand). This plan revolved around
                    stealing a brand-new generator right out from Azaikis' nose! Exciting!  </p>

                    <p class="sideb"> Another story is the hiring of their head janitor, Elias Riddle. Apparently, the chimera
                        was found as a cub hiding in a box in the factory remains when they first arrived. The two raised him up like a strange pet who just so happens to be sentient
                     with more cat-like behaviors than not. Like a true nepotism baby, Elias was given a job when he was old enough as the head janitor. </p>

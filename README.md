# Class Projects
Class Projects Repository
This repository is for class projects I have done over the course of my semesters at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).
Each project has been seperated into their own labeled folder for easier navigation.

## Project #1
This project I was tasked with replicating a magizine layout and turn it into a responsive layout, complete with our own text and images. I put in my own artwork and worldbuilding as the content.

## Project #2
I used Open Triva API as a basis for a website to generate triva questions and answers. The categories you select are saved into local storage.

## Project #3
Our final project for 235! It was to create an interactive web experience. I choose to do a visual novel-esque guessing game based around a fae. It includes messing with sound and javascript.

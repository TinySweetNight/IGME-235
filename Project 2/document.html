        Used Open Triva API.

        This project was pretty smooth-sailing until I tried to figure out a way to store the questions so they reappear when the site refreshes. I spent over an hour trying to figure that out but
        never achieved that, no matter what solutions I tried to look up, I never got that to work. It annoys me, but it's not really a requirement. Also I colored the scrollbar to be interesting.

        <b>Requirements:</b>
        I used Open Triva Api! The numbers, category, and difficulty are all saved into local storage and reappear when refreshed. The 3 controls are numbers, which you can put any number from 0 to 50- if you don't you will get a message explaining to do that,
         there are then two pulldowns that display the categories and difficulty. The graphic design got a lot of compliments during review so I count that as a win! The usser errors are handled, there are even messages when the API acts up because sometimes it gets overloaded or doesn't have the questions.
         There are messages for getting triva questions and the error messages. <br>
         Used only let and const. I suppose there is some D.R.Y in the storage section, but I feel like putting that in a loop would be weird, and quite frankly unnecessary. the names all begin with a lowercase letter.
         All code is commented as most of it is from previous excerises and merely modified to fit the project. Also all console().log calls are commented out expect for the error message just encase. <br>
         HTML5 and CSS is valid. <br>
         Also while I didn't use any CSS frameworks or flexbox, the project shrinks or expands to different sizes in a way where I am pretty happy with it. Adding flexbox messes with the format.
         <hr>
         I feel like this project would be roughly 95, some points taken off for the storage D.R.Y if that counts.

    <h1>Fae Encounter</h1>

    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>Navigate a conversation with a fae looking to make you a servant.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Genre/Platform</h2>
    <p>
        Genre: Visual Novel/Trivia <br>
        Platform: Desktop only
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Go over the rules of the fae, learn what to avoid when talking to a fae. The player progresses through selecting the correct dialogue choices. The mood should be tense as any incorrect answer ends in death, forcing the player to restart. The player just wants to survive the encounter</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>
        Art Style: Cartoonish- aka my style :D
        <br>
        Sound: Maybe something woodland? strings? It's orchestral rather than 8-bit. Maybe some nature sounds as a background music
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        Mechanics: It's a visual novel! The player will be presented with two options for dialogue which changes the outcome of the event. <br>
        Controls: Just simple mouse clicks on buttons that pop up with options. <br>
        Teaching the player: I don't think I would add instructions other than click on the option you want, this game is all about trial and error. <br>
        Player Learning: As mentioned before, trial and error, seeing what options are or aren't correct so the player learns how to survive a fae encounter.

        Process: I started off with marking out where the box for the fae needed to be, wrote down the sizes so I can draw the images without having to fiddle with resizing.
        Then I went to adding in the buttons and making sure the local storage works properly so it can save the stage you are on. Then I went ahead to impliment the wrong answers and the two
        different endings. This seems quite simple but I had a heck of a time getting the wrong answers and local storage to work properly whihc took up most of my time.

    <p>
        How I meet Requirements <br>
        <b>Functional: </b>The game works as mostly intended, I wanted the answers to switch during one stage but couldn't figure out for the life of me to get it to work. But it works like a visual novel
        with different endings depending on your answers. There is no errors that I have encountered, except on Banjo. <br> <br>
        <b>Design: </b>Graphic design is my passion and I drew the art for the fae in the center. When I was testing the game, everyone knew how to navigate the game with no instructions at all. 
        It is meant for PC/laptops so I didn't make it responsive or for smaller windows, but it should work nicely on Pc and Laptop screens with minimum or no scrolling. <br> <br>
        <b>Media:</b> The background images are jpgs while the faes are PNG because they need to be transparent. There is sound for background music and the button clicks. <br> <br>
        <b>HTML/CSS:</b> Okay, So, The CSS is valid but I had to get rid of my cool buttons which I am kinda mad about, Oh well, price for valid CSS. The background for the other one kept throwing errors because of the background had too many variables.
        The HTML is valid as well. <br> <br>
        <b>Code: </b>There is one class that I worked into an Enum class. There is no vars, and only queryselects. Identical code is handled. I don't think my code is that advanced or messy to have seperate .js files.. nor do I understand what it means by similar to Circle Blast.
        Vaiable and function names begin with a lowercase letter, code is commented, console.log() are deleted.
